Full Disclaimer: I can't be bothered to go through all the security steps to host this (also Heroku free plan is gone,) so you'll have to host it locally on your laptop, desktop, pi or something. Also there's no user accounts or anything, so you'll have to set that up AND go through the security steps [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/howto/deployment/checklist/). If you do end up setting something up, it uses [this template](https://www.bootstrapdash.com/product/corona-free).

Anyways, it keeps track of Events, Homework, Assessments (and their subtasks) and Subjects.
